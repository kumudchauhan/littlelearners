Interactive ebooks for toddlers — built by a mom, for her baby.

## Why I built this

My biggest motivation was to create content with **easy words and simple images** that my little one can actually speak and remember easily. I have so many books at home, and some of them have really long names like *hippopotamus*, *elephant*, *penguin* — words that are hard for a toddler to say or recall.

I wanted to create something **relatable**, with short everyday words my baby already knows or is learning, paired with clear images and an option for **speech** so she can hear the words spoken aloud.

I got tired of researching products that meet my expectations. Nothing quite matched my wishlist — so I decided to **create what I feel is best for my baby**.

The best part? I can keep the content **fully customizable** as she grows up. I can add more workbooks, new alphabets, harder words, and keep evolving the content to make learning fun — not a boring activity.

## What's inside

- **ABC Book** — Simple words (Apple, Ball, Car, Dog...) with big colorful letters and Twemoji illustrations
- **Numbers Book** — Count from 1 to 10 with visual objects, big numbers, and words
- **Shapes Book** — Learn shapes with SVG drawings showing colored sides & corners, plus real-world examples

Each page has:
- Large, crisp Twemoji SVG images
- Big, colorful text
- Tap-to-speak with a child-friendly voice
- Swipe navigation
- Summary pages (A-Z grid, 1-10 grid) where you can tap individual letters/numbers to hear them

## What's next

- Make these into a **compatible ebook format** that works on kids' tablets and Kindle (without speech support maybe, but still useful)
- Add more books — fruits, animals, vehicles, and more are already drafted
- Keep iterating as needs change and baby grows

This is the first version. We ship, we learn, we improve.
