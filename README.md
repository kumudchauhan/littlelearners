Interactive ebooks: Designed by a mom, for her baby!

## Why I built this

My biggest motivation was to create content for my 15 month daugher, who is learning to know the world, buidling vocab, trying to remember so many words. So I wanted some content that has **easy words and simple images** that my little one can actually speak and remember easily. I purchased so many books, and some of them have really long names like *hippopotamus*, *elephant*, *penguin* — words that are hard for a toddler to say or recall.

I wanted to create something **relatable**, with short everyday words my baby already knows or is learning, paired with clear images and an option for **speech** so she can hear the words spoken aloud.

I got tired of researching products, keeping track of age-specific educational content, that meet my expectations. Nothing quite matched my wishlist — so I decided to **create what I feel is best for my baby**.

The best part is that I can keep the content **fully customizable** as she grows up. I can add more workbooks, harder words, more realistic images, and keep evolving the content to make learning fun — not a boring activity.

## What's inside

- **Alphabets Book** — Simple words (Apple, Ball, Car, Dog...) with big colorful letters and Twemoji illustrations, and voice enabled fetaure.
- **Numbers Book** — Count from 1 to 10 with visual objects, big numbers, and words, with visual effect and sound during counting.
- **Coming soon...** — Many more in the series as we learn, and grow and, our intersts develop.

Each page has:
- Large, crisp Twemoji SVG images
- Big, colorful text
- Tap-to-speak with a child-friendly voice
- Swipe navigation
- Summary pages (A-Z grid, 1-10 grid) where you can tap individual letters/numbers to hear them

## What's next

- Make these into a **compatible ebook format** that works on kids' tablets and Kindle (without speech support maybe, but still useful)
- Add more books — fruits, animals, vehicles, and more are already drafted
- Keep iterating as needs change and baby grows

This is the first version. We ship, we learn, we improve.
